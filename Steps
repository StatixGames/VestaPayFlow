1. Web Scraping:

    Tool: Use Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Playwright for scraping dynamic content.
    Automation: Set up a scheduled scraper with cron jobs or AWS Lambda functions to run periodically.

2. Data Storage:

    SQL Database: Use Amazon RDS (for a managed SQL database) or Amazon DynamoDB (for NoSQL, if needed).
    Google Sheets Integration: Use the Google Sheets API if you want to keep a live spreadsheet for easy access.
    Alternative: You could use Amazon S3 with Athena to store and query CSV data if spreadsheets are the goal.

3. AWS Services:

    Lambda: Automate the scraping and data processing.
    EC2 or Fargate: Host the scraper if it requires a persistent or complex environment.
    RDS/DynamoDB: Store data in a scalable database.
    S3 & Athena: As an alternative to Google Sheets, this combo allows for scalable data storage and querying.
    EventBridge: Schedule scraping and data updates.
    API Gateway: If you want to create an API for this data.

4. Regular Updates:

    Scheduling: Use AWS EventBridge to trigger the scraping at set intervals.
    Notifications: Set up AWS SNS to notify you of new data or errors.

5. Data Visualization:

    Google Sheets: For quick viewing and sharing.
    AWS QuickSight: If you need advanced dashboards and analytics.
